# genetic.algo.optimizeR

The goal of `genetic.algo.optimizeR` is to optimize the function \( f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 4 \) using a genetic algorithm. The function represents a simple quadratic equation, and the goal is to find the value of \( x \) that minimizes the function.

Here's a breakdown of the aim and the results:

**Aim:**
- Optimize the function \( f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 4 \) to find the value of \( x \) that minimizes the function.

**Results:**
- **Initial Population**:
  - We start with a population of three individuals: \( x_1 = 1 \), \( x_2 = 3 \), and \( x_3 = 0 \).
- **Evaluation**:
  - We evaluate the fitness of each individual by calculating \( f(x) \) for each \( x \) value:
    - \( f(1) = 1^2 - 4*1 + 4 = 1 \)
    - \( f(3) = 3^2 - 4*3 + 4 = 1 \)
    - \( f(0) = 0^2 - 4*0 + 4 = 4 \)
- **Selection**:
  - We select individuals \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \) as parents for crossover because they have higher fitness.
- **Crossover and Mutation**:
  - We perform crossover and mutation on the selected parents to generate offspring: \( x_1' = 1 \), \( x_2' = 3 \).
- **Replacement**:
  - We replace individual \( x_1 \) with offspring \( x_1' \), maintaining the population size.

After multiple generations of repeating these steps, the genetic algorithm aims to converge towards an optimal or near-optimal solution. In this example, since it's simple and the solution space is small, we could expect the algorithm to converge relatively quickly towards the optimal solution \( x = 2 \), where \( f(x) = 0 \).
