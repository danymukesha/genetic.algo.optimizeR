***Theory***

```{r setup, results='hide', warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, include = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

1.  Initialize Population:
    -   Start with a population of individuals: X1(x=1), X2(x=3), X3(x=0).\
    (Note: the values are random and the population should be highly diversified)
    -   The space of x value is kept integer type and on range from 0 to 3,for simplification.
```{r}
population <- c(1, 3, 0)
```
    
2.  Evaluate Fitness:
    -   Calculate fitness(`f(x)`) for each individual:

        -   X1: f(1) = 1\^2 - 4\*1 + 4 = 1
        -   X2: f(3) = 3\^2 - 4\*3 + 4 = 1
        -   X3: f(0) = 0\^2 - 4\*0 + 4 = 4

        Coding the function f(x) in R A quadratic function is a function of the form: ax2+bx+c where a≠0

        So for$f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 4$

In R, we write:

```{r}
a = 1
b = -4
c = 4
f = function(x) {
  a*x^2 + b*x + c
}
```


Plotting the quadratic function f(x) First, we have to choose a domain over which we want to plot f(x).

Let’s try 0 ≤ x ≤ 3:

```{r initial_poputation, out.width="70%", fig.cap=""}
# Define the domain over which we want to plot f(x)
x <- seq(from=0, to=4, length.out=100)

# Define the domain over which we want to plot f(x) and create df data frame
df <- x |>
  data.frame(x =_) |>
  dplyr::mutate(y = f(x))

# Define the space over which we want to population to be
possible_xvalues <- seq(from=0, to=3, length.out=4)

# Create space data frame
space <- possible_xvalues |>
  data.frame(x = _) |>
  dplyr::mutate(y = f(x))

# Calculate fitness inline
fitness <- population^2 - 4 * population + 4

# Selected the surviving parents
num_parents <- 2
selected_parents <- population |>
  order(fitness, decreasing = FALSE) |>
  head(num_parents)

# Plot f(x) using ggplot
ggplot2::ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_line(color = "black") +  # Plot the function as a line
  geom_point(data = subset(space, x %in% c(1,3)), color = "coral1", size = 3, shape = 8) +  # Plot points at x=1 and x=3
  geom_point(data = subset(space, (x ==0 )), color = "blue", size = 3, shape = 8) +  # Plot a point at x=0
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed", color = "blue") +  # Add horizontal line at y=0
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed", color = "blue") +  # Add vertical line at x=0
  theme_minimal()
```

3.  Selection:
    -   Select parents for crossover:

        -   Y1(x=1), Y2(x=3)

```{r selection, out.width="70%", fig.cap=""}
# Plot f(x) using ggplot
ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_line(color = "black") +  # Plot the function as a line
  geom_point(data = subset(space, x %in% c(1, 3)), color = "coral1", size = 6, shape = 8) +  # Plot points at x=1 and x=3
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed", color = "blue") +  # Add horizontal line at y=0
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed", color = "blue") +  # Add vertical line at x=0
  theme_minimal()  # Use a minimal theme
```

4.  Crossover and Mutation:
    -   Generate offspring through crossover and mutation:
        -   Z1(x=1), Z2(x=3) (no mutation in this example)
5.  Replacement:
    -   Replace individuals in the population:
        -   Replace X3 with Z1, maintaining the population size.
6.  Repeat Steps 2-5 for multiple generations until a termination condition is met.

The optimal/fitting individuals *F* of a quadratic equation, in this case the lowest point on the graph of f(x), is: 

$$
F\left(\frac{-b}{2a}, f\left(\frac{-b}{2a}\right)\right)
$$

```{r fitting, out.width="70%", fig.cap=""}
find.fitting = function(a, b, c) {
  x_fitting = -b/(2 * a)
  y_fitting = f(x_fitting)
  c(x_fitting, y_fitting)
}
F = find.fitting(a, b, c)
```

Adding the Fitting to the plot:

```{r fitting_plot, out.width="70%", fig.cap=""}
# Plot f(x) using ggplot
ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_line(color = "black") +  # Plot the function as a line
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed") +  # Add horizontal line at y=0
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed") +  # Add vertical line at x=0
  geom_point(x = F[1], y = F[2], shape = 18, size = 6, color = "red") +  # Plot the vertex
  geom_text(x = F[1], y = F[2], label = "Fitting", vjust = -1, color = "red", size = 5) +  # Add label next to the vertex
  theme_minimal()  # Use a minimal theme
```

Finding the x-intercepts of ***f(x)***

The x-intercepts are the solutions of the quadratic equation f(x) = 0; they can be found by using the quadratic formula:

$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$

The quantity $b2–4ac$ is called the discriminant:

-   if the discriminant is positive, then *f(x)* has 2 solutions (i.e. x-intercepts).
-   if the discriminant is zero, then *f(x)* has 1 solution (i.e. 1 x-intercept).
-   if the discriminant is negative, then *f(x)* has no real solutions (i.e. does not intersect the x-axis).


```{r function_intercepts}
# find the x-intercepts of f(x)
find.roots = function(a, b, c) {
  discriminant = b^2 - 4 * a * c
  if (discriminant > 0) {
    c((-b - sqrt(discriminant))/(2 * a), (-b + sqrt(discriminant))/(2 * a))
  }
  else if (discriminant == 0) {
    -b / (2 * a)
  }
  else {
    NaN
  }
}
solutions = find.roots(a, b, c)
```

Adding the x-intercepts to the plot:
```{r plot_intercepts, out.width="70%", fig.cap=""}
  # Plot f(x) using ggplot
ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_line(color = "black") +  # Plot the function as a line
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed") +  # Add horizontal line at y=0
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed") +  # Add vertical line at x=0
  geom_point(data = data.frame(x = solutions, y = rep(0, length(solutions))), shape = 18, size = 6, color = "red") +  # Plot x-intercepts
  geom_text(data = data.frame(x = solutions, y = rep(0, length(solutions)), label = "Fitting(x-intercept)"), aes(label = label), vjust = -1, color = "red", size = 5) +  # Add labels next to x-intercepts
  theme_minimal()  # Use a minimal theme
```
